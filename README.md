- I made everything linkable. For the header I made the "About me, My Work and Contact me" to navigate to each section when clicking on it, for the projects in "My Work" section when clicking on each project it's going to navigate you to its deployed site, and lastly I attached my GitHub link at the "Contact me" and linked it to GitHub page.
